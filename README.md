# Python-Learning-day12
Hello Everyone... 🙋  🐍 Python Learning Update. Today I practiced the basics of Python and explored how the `String Indexing` works. Day-12.
🔷String indexing in Python allows you to access individual characters using their position within square brackets ( [ ] ). Strings are zero-indexed.

✅Positive
 🔹 Counts from the beginning of the string (left to right), starting at 0.
 word = "Python"
 print(word[1])

🔹 Used to display output on the screen 
🔹 Helps in debugging and understanding program flow 
🔹 Essential for beginners in Python programming

Starting with fundamentals and building step by step towards stronger problem-solving skills.

Learning one concept every day. 🚀
